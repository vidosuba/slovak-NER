# Contextualized Language Model-based Named Entity Recognition in Slovak Texts

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the fundamental tasks in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), with English state-of-the-art approaches generally
utilizing neural models. The currently available NER classifiers for Slovak
texts are either rule- and vocabulary-based systems or employ multilingual
Contextualized Language Models. Both of these show poor performance
compared to the language-specific Deep Contextualized Language Models,
even in low-resource languages, such as Slovak.

## Goals
- Review the existing NER models and the datasets they are trained on
- Refine and extend the annotated (Slovak) datasets for NER
- Take advantage of transfer learning between multilingual and Slovak NER
models
